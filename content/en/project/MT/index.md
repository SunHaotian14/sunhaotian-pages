title: Development and Application of 10kV-level Voltage Sag Compensation Device
summary: In this project, we designed the 10kV voltage sag compensation device. The prototype device was verified by two hardware-in-loop(HIL) machine(one dSpace represents the control circuits and one RT Box for the power circuits).

Among the various power quality problems, voltage sag has become one of the most significant factors degrading power supply quality. Voltage sags usually have short duration ad yields serious impacts on the sensitive loads. In recent years, the demand is raised for the prevention of voltage sags in the 10kV sensitive load group. However, attractive solutions are absent. In response to this actual demand, this project develops 10kV voltage sag compensation equipment with good performance and low cost. Through preliminary investigation and comparison, the project decided to develop a prototype of a 10kV voltage sag compensation device with energy storage. On this basis, a 10kV/2MW prototype is trial-produced, and then field application verification is carried out to form a complete solution and technical data.
