abstract: "A comprehensive evaluation approach of power quality based on AHP and optimal membership is proposed in this paper. This paper selects the appropriate power quality indexes by analyzing the characteristic of power quality. The continuous power quality indexes can be reasonably analyzed by establishing the fuzzy membership function and the transient power quality can be calculated according to IEEE 1564-2014. In addition, the weight of each index can be determined dynamically which includes both subjective part and objective part. Finally, an IEEE-18 standard test system with non-linear loads and compensation devices is applied to prove the validity of the proposed evaluation system."
