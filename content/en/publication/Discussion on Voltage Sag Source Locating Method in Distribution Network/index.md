abstract: "This paper analyzes different voltage sag source locating methods based on different monitoring devices, including the methods for fault source tracing based on power quality monitoring device, and the fault source locating method based on voltage sag monitoring device. This analysis would be a guide for monitoring device allocation. In particular, a clear summary of the steps of different positioning methods is performed. On this basis, the necessary grid network topology and sag information for different locating methods are further elaborated. At the same time, different locating methods are compared in terms of fault tolerance, accuracy, and rapidity. Finally, prospects of future work are given.
