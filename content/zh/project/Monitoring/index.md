Voltage sag has been considered as one of the most important power quality problems affecting the normal operations of electrical equipment. This further leads to excessive investment or insufficient prevention and control capabilities, resulting in greater losses. However, traditional voltage sag source identification methods usually yield a large amount of calculation and result in a narrow application range. Therefore, a complete system for evaluating the voltage-sag severity is strongly needed; the voltage sag sources should be accurately located. 

This project develops an online monitoring system for voltage sags; The development includes extraction, classification, and identification of different voltage sag sources;  Meanwhile, the project also evaluates quantitatively the severity of voltage sags in different events and for different substations, and regional power grids; we also aim to detect voltage sag source monitorability and precise fault location. For different types of power-sensitive users, the online monitoring and analysis of voltage sags, power generation side, as well as user side, is the key point for improving the quality of power supply to sensitive power users, and for reducing unnecessary investment and improve system stability.
