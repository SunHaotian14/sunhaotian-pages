title: Prototype of Remote-controlled Vehicle 
summary: By harnessing Respberry Pi, Arduino board and some interfacing circuits, we managed to synthesize a remote-controlled vehicle model which could send the real-time streaming and receive the control signal from the dedicated website.  <br>This project was part of my summer stage in the energy departement in Supélec. I recorded in detail (in French) throughout the developping process in one of my blog. Just click to check it out :)
