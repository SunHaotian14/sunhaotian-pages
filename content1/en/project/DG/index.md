With the advancement and wide application of distributed power technologies such as energy storage, power grid systems are undergoing fundamental changes throughout their structures. One major problem caused by voltage sag is the degradation of the power supply quality,  which consists of a large number of distributed power sources such as energy storage.  

This project is aimed at the distribution network in the presence of distributed power sources such as energy storage. We studied the influence of distributed power sources on the voltage sag propagation mechanism. Based on this, we designed economic monitoring equipment configuration strategies as well as efficient voltage sag type identification technology and accurate voltage sag source location technology. The project intends to further understand the influence mechanism of voltage sags in distribution networks containing distributed power sources through the above research, and provide systematic analysis and solutions for the effective prevention and control of voltage sags.
